//! Olympus Envoy — the runtime-holder library (ADR 0008).
//!
//! Envoy-side code extracted from the monolith (milestone S2): agent
//! discovery, the ACP bridge + adapters, and the per-session runtime table.
//! In S2 the monolith (`olympus-control-plane`) still links this crate
//! in-process; the standalone `olympus-envoy` binary arrives in S3.
