# ADR 0019 agent CLI adversarial rereview

**Verdict: NO-GO**

The rewrite closes B1-B3 and B5-B7 and all eight non-blocking precision items. B4 remains incomplete: the CLI still promises a recoverable run ID in a response-loss window where it may know only the client operation ID, and resumable watch behavior still has no cursor-retention/compaction contract.

The source review contains B1-B7 only: B7 ends at `docs/reviews/0019-agent-cli-adversarial-review.md:167-188`, and P1 begins at `:190-196`. There is no B8 to reconcile; the B8 row below records that source discrepancy rather than inventing a finding.

## B1-B8 reconciliation

| ID | Status | Current reconciliation and exact sources |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | **Resolved** | V1 is UDS-only; path/mount/DAC, per-runtime identity, peer evidence, connection-derived context, FD delegation, accepted-connection revocation, and hostile tests are explicit (`docs/adrs/0019-agent-and-human-cli-interface.md:252-295`; `docs/adrs/0017-session-cutover-and-remote-development-plane.md:132-150`; `docs/plans/2026-07-13-session-cutover-remote-development.md:309-351`). |
| B2 | **Resolved** | Axis atomically authorizes, canonicalizes, reserves scoped operation identity plus intent/fence, defines same-ID digest behavior and revocation linearization, and gates crash/concurrency cases (`docs/adrs/0019-agent-and-human-cli-interface.md:297-322`; `docs/plans/2026-07-13-session-cutover-remote-development.md:336-351`). |
| B3 | **Resolved** | `stellarc.workflow-input/v1` is a closed, publication-validated profile with injective names, bounded types/regex/rendering, opaque bindings, exact JSON scope, canonical defaults/digest, and shared conformance fixtures (`docs/adrs/0019-agent-and-human-cli-interface.md:97-179`; `docs/plans/2026-07-13-session-cutover-remote-development.md:481-516`; `docs/cards/arch/cli-1-agent-stellarc-interface.md:39-46,55-57`). |
| B4 | **Open** | Non-blocking `workflows.run` plus adapter-side get/watch is now explicit, but ambiguous interruption and cursor lifetime remain underspecified (`docs/adrs/0019-agent-and-human-cli-interface.md:181-213`; `docs/plans/2026-07-13-session-cutover-remote-development.md:491-516`). See remaining blocker below. |
| B5 | **Resolved** | ADR 0013 and WF-1 now require JOBS-2 planned intent, exact fenced attempt reconciliation, and `StepIndeterminate`; WF-1's build dependencies are dispatch-blocking (`docs/adrs/0013-workflow-kernel-bounded-chains.md:64-78,102-113`; `docs/cards/arch/wf-1-workflow-kernel.md:3-29,41-52`; `docs/plans/2026-07-13-session-cutover-remote-development.md:52-55,469-516`). |
| B6 | **Resolved** | The canonical mapping and exhaustive versioned operation registry define types, scope, policy, idempotency, revocation, availability, audit, and adapter equivalence; raw operator argv DTOs remain outside agent operations (`docs/adrs/0019-agent-and-human-cli-interface.md:81-95,324-356`; `docs/plans/2026-07-13-session-cutover-remote-development.md:326-351,371-397,434-455`). |
| B7 | **Resolved** | The top-level graph names exact WF-1, self-development, and soak predecessors and makes them dispatch-blocking; both CLI-1 and WF-1 repeat the hard edges (`docs/plans/2026-07-13-session-cutover-remote-development.md:36-70`; `docs/cards/arch/cli-1-agent-stellarc-interface.md:17-26`; `docs/cards/arch/wf-1-workflow-kernel.md:26-29`). |
| B8 | **N/A** | No B8 exists in the source review (`docs/reviews/0019-agent-cli-adversarial-review.md:167-196`). |

## P1-P8 reconciliation

All eight precision items were rechecked and are resolved in the current normative text:

## Remaining blocker

### B4 — Ambiguous interruption and cursor expiry still lack executable terminal semantics

**Current sources:**

- `docs/adrs/0019-agent-and-human-cli-interface.md:183-189` promises that every interrupted waiter prints a durable run ID and reconnect command.
- `docs/adrs/0019-agent-and-human-cli-interface.md:195-198` makes the same promise for client timeout.
- `docs/adrs/0019-agent-and-human-cli-interface.md:200-213` correctly creates the operation ID before send and says pre-response interruption first reconciles it, but defines neither reconciliation failure nor watch cursor retention/expiry.
- `docs/plans/2026-07-13-session-cutover-remote-development.md:498-516` requires monotonic resume and interruption tests, but no unavailable-reconciliation or expired/compacted-cursor oracle.

**Blocking failure sequence:** The client sends `workflows.run`; Axis commits the run; the response is lost; then Axis or the gateway is unreachable when Ctrl-C or `--timeout` fires. The client has the stable operation ID but cannot obtain the promised run ID. The documents provide no bounded exit or machine error carrying an unknown-acceptance recovery ID, so implementations may block past timeout, print a false run ID, or discard the only reconciliation key. Separately, `watch(after_sequence)` has no declared never-expire guarantee and no `cursor_expired`/terminal-snapshot fallback, so reconnect behavior is undefined if retained events are compacted.

**Required correction:**

1. If operation-ID reconciliation cannot complete within the client deadline, return a typed `acceptance_unknown` result containing the operation ID and exact retry/reconcile command; promise a run ID only after successful reconciliation.
2. Declare workflow watch cursors non-expiring in v1, or define retention, typed expiry, and `workflows.get` terminal-snapshot fallback without redispatch.
3. Add black-box gates for commit + lost response + unavailable Axis/gateway + Ctrl-C/timeout, and for reconnect after cursor expiry/compaction (or prove v1 events are never compacted).

Re-review only B4 after those contracts and gates are added; the other findings do not need reopening unless their source hashes change.
